\title{
Elementary effects sensitivity analysis
}
\description{
This function performs the an elementary effects sensitivity analysis on the sample data produced by a LSD simulation model using the Morris (1991) one-at-a-time sampling method.
}
\usage{
elementary.effects.lsd(data, p = 4, jump = 2)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
an object created by a previous call to \code{\link{read.doe.lsd}} which contains all the required experimental data for the analysis.
}
  \item{p}{
integer: the number of levels of the DoE as set in LSD when the DoE was configured. The default is 4 (also the LSD default).
}
  \item{jump}{
integer: the size of the jump (increase/decrease) for each point change in the DoE as set in LSD when the DoE was configured. The default is 2 (also the LSD default).
}
}
\details{
The elementary effects analysis statistics are only meaningful if the DoE was created using the Morris design, as when LSD \code{EE Sampling...} option is used to produce the DoE.

This function is a wrapper to the function \code{\link[sensitivity]{morris}} in \code{\link[sensitivity]{sensitivity-package}}.
}
\value{
The function returns an object/list of class \code{morris} containing several items, among them (see \code{\link[sensitivity]{morris}} for full details):

\item{table}{the elementary effects sensitivity analysis results data.}

The returned object can also be directly printed or plotted using \code{plot()} or any similar function.

\examples{
# Examples require the data files produced by LSD, please check the package
# notes and LSD documentation on how to generate you simulation results files.
# Please note that the full set of sensitivity analysis files must be available,
# as detailed in the help page for the read.doe.lsd function.

# Steps to use this function:
# 1. define the variables you want to use in the analysis
# 2. load data from a LSD simulation saved results using read.doe.lsd
# 3. perform the elementary effects analysis applying elementary.effects.lsd
