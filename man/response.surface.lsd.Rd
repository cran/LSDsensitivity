\title{
Generate the meta-model 3D response surface data
}
\description{
This function produces a data object for the three-dimensional graphical representations of the meta-model response surfaces for a set of factors (parameters), including the confidence interval for the surfaces.
}
\usage{
response.surface.lsd(data, model, sa, gridSz = 25, defPos = 2,
                     factor1 = 0, factor2 = 0, factor3 = 0)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
an object created by a previous call to \code{\link{read.doe.lsd}} which contains all the required experimental data for the analysis.
}
  \item{model}{
an object created by a previous call to \code{\link{kriging.model.lsd}} or \code{\link{polynomial.model.lsd}} which contains the meta-model estimated hyper-parameters.
}
  \item{sa}{
an object created by a previous call to \code{\link{sobol.decomposition.lsd}} which contains the estimated total and conditional variances for all the meta-model factors.
}
  \item{gridSz}{
integer: the number of divisions in the 3D wire frame grid. The default is 25.
}
  \item{defPos}{
1, 2, 3: the position of the default/calibration configuration on the 3 plot sequence. The default is 2 (center position).
}
  \item{factor1}{
integer: the index of the first most-important factor: 0 = automatic selection (according to the Sobol index, the default); any other number = the selected factor index, according to DoE factor order.
}
  \item{factor2}{
integer: the index of the second most-important factor: 0 = automatic selection (according to the Sobol index, the default); any other number = the selected factor index, according to DoE factor order.
}
  \item{factor3}{
integer: the index of the third most-important factor: 0 = automatic selection (according to the Sobol index, the default); any other number = the selected factor index, according to DoE factor order.
}
}
\details{
This function produces data for three different wire frame 3D plots. In the 3 plots, the x-y plan is defined by the 2 most-important factors (calculated or set by the user in \code{\link{sobol.decomposition.lsd}}) and the z axis represents the response variable chosen. The three different plots shows the response surface for three values of the third most-important factor: the minimum, the default/calibration and the maximum. The order the three response surfaces are shown is defined by \code{defPos}.

The automatically set most-important factors can be overridden by any factors chosen by the user by the usage of the arguments \code{factor1}, \code{factor2} and \code{factor3}. This way, the response surfaces can be represented for a combination of any 3 factors (parameters) in the model.
}
\value{
The function returns an object/list of class \code{response} containing three similar objects, one for each 3D plot, each of them comprised of:

\item{calib}{the predicted meta-model response values on each point of the 3D grid.}
\item{factor}{the predicted values for each individual factor.}
\item{default}{the predicted values for the default/calibration configuration.}

\examples{
# Examples require the data files produced by LSD, please check the package
# notes and LSD documentation on how to generate you simulation results files.
# Please note that the full set of sensitivity analysis files must be available,
# as detailed in the help page for the read.doe.lsd function.

# Steps to use this function:
# 1. define the variables you want to use in the analysis
# 2. load data from a LSD simulation saved results using read.doe.lsd
# 3. fit a Kriging (or polynomial) meta-model using kriging.model.lsd
# 4. identify the most influential factors applying sobol.decomposition.lsd
# 5. calculate the response surface for the selected factors using model.limits.lsd
# 6. plot the response surface
